# Seq2Seq

This aim of the project is implement the following Sequence-2-Sequence models from scratch :- </br>
(i) Simple Encoder Decoder. </br>
(ii) Encoder Decoder with Attention Layer. (Three different approaches were used to calculate the attention scores) </br>

BLEU Score is then used to evaluate both the models for translating Italian sentences to English, and the results of the two approaches are compared at the end.
