# Seq2Seq

This aim of the project is implement the following Sequence-2-Sequence models from scratch :-
(i) Simple Encoder Decoder
(ii) Encoder Decoder with Attention Layer. (Three different approaches were used to calculate the attention scores)

BLEU Score is then used to evaluate both the models for translating Italian sentences to English, and the results of the two approaches are compared at the end.
